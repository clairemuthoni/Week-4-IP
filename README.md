# Week-4-IP
We are working under Autolib as the datascientists, we will be reviewing the data of April 2018. 
The data you will see in this repository will be a python notebook. 
Inside this python notebook , you will find pandas, we used pandas to read the csv file from the dataset provided and we
then we cleaned the data using the validity check , the completeness check, the accuracy check, the uniformity check and the 
consistency check. 
You will also find that we have done our analysis using pandas as well. I opted to do this because pandas is very flexible and 
I am slightly comfortable with it. 
Our analysis answers questions such as which towns are the most used by autolib cars.
